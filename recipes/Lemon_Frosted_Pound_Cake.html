  <h2>intro</h2>
  <p>Pound cake , the reason why it is called pound cake, is mainly because in the most original recipe, one pound of butter, one pound of sugar, one pound of eggs and one pound of flour are used . Each ingredient is equal to Heavy, that's where its name comes from.
    The pound cake we made today uses the ingredients of the original recipe (European grandmother's pound cake without baking powder), and does not add baking powder . The ingredients are simple and easy to make. Even a novice baker can easily get started.

    The lemon pound cake made with this recipe has a dense and moist texture and a strong natural lemon aroma. It is perfect for enjoying with hot tea. The important thing is that after iced, the taste is just as perfect.
In addition to this classic lemon pound cake, you can also change it to different flavors, such as our other recipe: " Chocolate Marble Cake ". The recipe is similar, but it has a completely different taste and interest!
Or itâ€™s a French weekend cake (travel pound cake) , which has a unique flavor and method. I hope you will like this pound cake recipe.
