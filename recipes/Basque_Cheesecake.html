The caramel appearance is slightly wrinkled and the edges are not smooth at all, but it tastes like a combination of smoky burnt aroma and soft milky aroma. The taste can be said to be very unique, and it uses simple materials and does not require too much work to make. , claiming to be almost error-free.

  <h2>Basque cheesecake recipe steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Take the cream cheese out of the refrigerator in advance, cut it into small pieces and spread it out on baking paper. This will help it soften faster. You can also use a microwave oven or water heating to soften it quickly.
    </li>
    <li>Place two layers of baking paper on the baking pan, then cut off the excess length, leaving a height of 1.5~2 inches that protrudes from the baking pan.
    </li>
    <li>Beat the cream cheese at medium speed until it becomes very smooth, then add the caster sugar and continue to beat until it becomes a batter, and no grainy texture of sugar can be felt at all.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the three eggs in batches. When adding each egg, make sure that the previous egg has been mixed evenly. Don't forget to scrape off the batter on the side of the bowl to ensure that there are no lumps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Take another bowl, sift the low flour, then add part of the fresh cream and mix thoroughly. When there are no lumps of flour, pour in the remaining fresh cream and mix thoroughly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour the fresh cream batter into the cream cheese batter, then add vanilla extract and lemon juice, and beat at low speed until the batter becomes smooth and fine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sieve the batter and slowly pour it into the baking pan lined with baking paper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 220°C and bake for 35-45 minutes
    </li>
